# Google Reverse Geocoding with Tkinter Interface using Python

Integration project between the Google Reverse Geocoding API and Tkinter for a graphical interface.

The code has the purpose of making a script that reads an excel that has mandatory columns of coordinates named "Latitude" and "Longitude". Then a script of these coordinates is made through Google Reverse Geocoding and returned, in another excel, a column called "Endereco" containing the addresses already decoded.

## Interface
The developed interface was very simple. But the Tkinter library allows you to customize it however you want.

To use it, we need to import an Excel file and apply a valid Google API key.

Soon after it is possible to obtain a spreadsheet with the address and next to a map showing the points.

## Map
As mentioned, it is possible to obtain a map that shows the points that have been chosen.
